### Setup Instructions: {#setup}
This project can be opened via cloning/downloading repository:
1. Download this repository from its Github Repository located [here.](https://github.com/Quin-Riley-A/galactic-age-calc)
2. Locate the download destination folder on your local machine.
3. Unzip the downloaded folder if necessary.
4. Ensure all files are present from your download folder, namely:
  - \__tests__ folder:
    - utility folder:
      - ageAssign.tests.js
      - millToDays.tests.js
    - ages.tests.js
  - css folder:
    - bootstrap.css
    - styles.css
  - src folder:
    - classes folder:
      - ages.js
    - utility folder:
      -ageAssign.js
      - millToDays.js
    - index.html
    - index.js
    - scripts.js
  - .babelrc
  - .eslintrc
  - .gitignore
  - package-lock.json
  - package.json
  - LICENSE
  - README.md
  - webpack.config.js

5. Navigate to your decompressed download destination folder within the terminal and run the following command to install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

6. Following this, use the following command to generate a bundled package containing the working html file:
```bash
npm run build
```

7. Next, to set up a development server, within the same directory run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
npm run start
```

8. Alternatively to step 7: After step 6 is successfully completed, navigate to the dist folder within the root directory and open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
  * Note that by opening the program directly from the dist/index.html no changes made to the code while the webpage is opened will be registered. To register the effects of changes on the browser steps 6 and 8 will need to be repeated.

### Known Bugs: {#bugs}
In the event that (disallowed values) are entered into [MORE INFO] If you experience this issue, please message the producer of your current repository and include any relevant form/page information. Thank you for your patience as I work on any issues!

The page may experience formatting issues when opened on mobile devices or tablets/laptops in smaller windows. Page should still be legible but general project layout will shift in potentially unforeseen manner. Thus, it is recommended to open the HTML index page in browser or file explorer in as full a screen as hardware allows.

Additionally, included image does not scale-down to fit to smaller screen sizes and may take up a majority of the screen when scrolling through the site from a mobile (or other small-screened) device.
